# Class 5 Demo

A demonstration of various interactivity features in Mapbox GL JS.

- **Hover state** - uses `featureState` to alter the style of the fill layer on hover.
- **Get feature properties on click** - extract data from the clicked feature and use JQuery to present it outside of the map.
- **flyTo() and fitBounds()** - Use buttons from another part of the site to control the map's camera.
- **Layer Toggle** - When the button is clicked, use `setLayoutProperty()` to set the visibility of layers to `visible` or `none`.
